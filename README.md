### üìÇ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository (or create the folders):**

    ```bash
    # If you have a Git repository, clone it.
    git clone https://github.com/ArnavGupta021/qr-code-generator.git
    cd qr-code-generator
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and save the provided `main.py` file.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install "fastapi[all]" qrcode
    # Save the main.py file here.
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory, create the React app, and save the provided `App.jsx` file.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
    npm install
    # Replace the content of src/App.jsx with the provided code.
    ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `backend` directory.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Leave this terminal open.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    Open another terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
